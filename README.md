# KitchenStory

A simple community recipe app built with Vite, React (JavaScript), and Tailwind.

Features planned:
- Add and edit recipes (title, ingredients, steps, additional info)
- Generate PDFs with multiple layouts
- Share recipe links with friends

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Lint: `npm run lint`
4. Format: `npm run format`

Next steps: implement UI forms, storage (local or backend), PDF export, and sharing routes.
